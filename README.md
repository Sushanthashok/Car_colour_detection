# 🚗 Car Colour Detection Model  

### 📘 Internship Project — 2025  
**Developed by:** *[Your Name]*  

---

## 🧠 Project Overview  

This project detects **cars and people at a traffic signal** using a **YOLOv8** object detection model.  
It predicts each car’s **colour** (Blue or Other) and counts the **total number of cars** and **people** in the frame.

---

## 🎯 Objectives  

- Detect **cars** and **people** in images or videos using **YOLOv8**.  
- Classify detected cars as **Blue** or **Other** using **HSV colour analysis**.  
- Draw bounding boxes:
  - 🟥 **Red** → Blue cars  
  - 🟦 **Blue** → Other cars  
- Display counts for:
  - Total cars  
  - Blue cars  
  - Other cars  
  - People present in the frame  
- Provide a **Streamlit GUI** with a live preview of the input and processed results.
